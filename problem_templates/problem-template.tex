\section*{Problem 1:} 

\subsubsection*{problem statement}

\subsubsection*{understanding the problem}

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{The unknown}
 \item \textbf{The data} 
 \item \textbf{The condition} 
\end{itemize}

Is the condition satisfiable? Is it insufficient to determine the unknown? is it redundant?
Draw a figure. Introduce notation.

\subsubsection*{developing a plan}

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Do you know a related problem?}
 \item \textbf{Focus on the unknown. What other problems share it?}
 \item \textbf{classify previous work} \textit{can you use it's result?, method? can an auxiliary element be introduced to make its use possible?}
 \item \textbf{Can you restate the problem?} \textit{go back to definitions}
 \item \textbf{can the problem statement be modified?}
 \item \textbf{Have you used everything?} \textit{all the data? the whole condition? have you taken into account all the esential notions?}
\end{itemize}
